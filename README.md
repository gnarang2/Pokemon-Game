# Pokemon-Game
Designed a Pokemon game in SystemVerilog on FPGA. Wrote VGA controller for graphics &amp; animations: character sprites from flash memory &amp; background from SRAM. Enabled user‑controlled movement/interactions through USB keyboard using EZ‑OTG chip. Understood &amp; connected a SoundDriver; conducted unit testing through a test bench, &amp; optimized RTL digital design by Quartus’ Power &amp; Synthesis analysis tools.

This project was a part of a class and used class material for the VGA connection and USB connection, however a link for the video is as follows:
